# Baby-Log
> Baby-Log is a web application that is combination of a personal problem for which we have not found an existing solution that is good enough (not even for a fee).
> That's why we decided to develop a dedicated application for the problem, and at the same time also use it for our final project in our Bachelor's degree in Information Systems.
> website. Created by Haim Goldsten & Kfir Maziar.
> It is built using "Angular" freamwork and "Bootstrap 5"/"Angular Materials" for the UI (Gradually we change the whole UI design from Bootstrap 5 to Angular Materials).

## Usage
The Baby-Log application is designed to simplify tracking important information about your baby and make it easy to share updates instantly with family members, such as parents and grandparents. 
The app allows you to effortlessly keep track of all activities and events related to your baby, as well as monitor their growth over time.
